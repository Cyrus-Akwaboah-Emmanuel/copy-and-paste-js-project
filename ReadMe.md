# **Overview**
This is a copy-and-paste project where a user gets to type in the first box and can click on the "copy text" to copy the text and paste it in the other box by clicking the "paste text" button. The point of this project is to test myself on my JavaScript journey.

# **What I learned**
I learned about the navigator clipboard, which is an API in JS. `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` for copying the text to the clipboard and `navigator.clipboard.readText()` for pasting the text. I just added `async` and `await` to the list of must-know functionalities.
